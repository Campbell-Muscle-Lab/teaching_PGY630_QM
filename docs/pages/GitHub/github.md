# GitHub

All of the material used in this course is available from [this repository on GitHub](https://github.com/Campbell-Muscle-Lab/teaching_PGY630_QM).

## Accessing the material

The _best way_ to download the material (and keep your computer up to date as information is added) is to use the GitHub desktop client.

See[GitHub_repos](https://campbell-muscle-lab.github.io/howtos_GitHub/pages/github_repos/github_repos.html) for instructions and an introductory video.

## An alternative

As an alternative, you can download a Zip file by clicking on the green Code button. Note that this just gives you a single snapshot of the material. You will have to repeat this process each time the site is updated.
