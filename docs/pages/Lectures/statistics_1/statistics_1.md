# Statistics 1

## Objectives

+ Explain the difference between a standard deviation and a standard error of the mean
+ Define the t-statistic
+ Interpet values of t and p
+ Describe when to use a one-sample, a two-sample, and a paired t-test

## Background

Many people have been shown equations that define standard deviations and standard errors. Some have also been taught that t-tests are used to compare two groups.

These videos try to explain, through examples, what the different measures show and how t-tests "work" without delving too far into the underlying theory. After you have studied this material, you should have a better understanding of whether t-tests (and moreover, what type of t-test) are appropriate for your data.
