# Statistics 2

## Objectives

+ Recall that ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) tests for differences between the means of 2 or more groups
+ Recognize the difference between one-way and two-ANOVA
+ Explain the difference beween main effects and post-hoc tests
+ Be able to perform 'simple' one-way and two-way tests
+ Appricate that more sophisticated techniques (for example, repeated measures, linear mixed models, etc.) provide greater statistical power for certain experimental designs

## Background

ANOVA is a statistical approach that tests for differences between groups. It is a commonly-used approach in many types of physiology but not it is not always well-understood. These videos try to explain, through examples, how the tests work and how to interpret them.
