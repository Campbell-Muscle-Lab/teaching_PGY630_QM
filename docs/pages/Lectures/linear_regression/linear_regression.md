# Linear regression

This material is presented as a series of short videos that show
+ how to fit a straight line to data by minimizing the sum of squares error
+ one (of many) ways of calculating a regression line in MATLAB
+ a demonstration of finding a low p value when you fit a line to random data

### Demonstration of p values

Calculates p values for points selected from random data, demonstrating that low p values can occur in a data that really has no relation between x and y.
