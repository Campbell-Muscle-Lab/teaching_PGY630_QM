# Image processing basics

## Objectives

+ Explain how computers store image data including details about the number of pixels, bit resolution, and color-spaces
+ Recognize that different image formats hvae distinct strengths and weaknesses
+ Recall the difference between bitmap and vector-based formats and know when to use each

## Background

Many science projects involve pictures or data acquired through image scans. Concepts such as bit resolution, color-space, and image format are important for rigor and reproducibility. This lecture explains some of the basic concepts and sets the stage for future lessons focused on image processing.
