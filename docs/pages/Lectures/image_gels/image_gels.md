# Image gel analysis

## Objectives

+ Recognize that scanning a gel of blot produces a "picture" that can be analyzed using image processing techniques
+ Recall that the image format is important because it defines how the data are stored (and could discard useful information)
  + Note that images should use as much of the dynamic range as possible (bit resolution) without "clipping"
+ Realize that lanes can be analyzed using curve-fitting techniques
